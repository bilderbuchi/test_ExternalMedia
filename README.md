# ExternalMedia

The `ExternalMedia` library provides a framework for interfacing external codes computing fluid properties to Modelica.Media-compatible component models.

## Library description

The ExternalMedia library provides a framework for interfacing external codes computing fluid properties to Modelica.Media-compatible component models.

The current version of the library supports pure and pseudo-pure fluids models, possibly two-phase, compliant with the Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium interface.

The library includes a pre-compiled interface to the FluidProp software, http://www.fluidprop.com, and built-in access to CoolProp, http://coolprop.org.

As of February 2014, the library has been tested with Dymola and OpenModelica under Windows. Support for more tools and operating systems might
be added in the future
