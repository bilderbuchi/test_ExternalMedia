# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ExternalMedia LIBRARY

The provided version of ExternalMedia is compatible with Modelica
Standard Library 3.2.1.

You can also use it with Modelica Standard Library 3.2, provided you 
change the uses annotation in the package.mo file of the Modelica package
root directory to uses(Modelica(version = "3.2")).

Previous versions of the Modelica Standard Library are no longer supported.

For installation, check out the content of the Modelica directory 
library from the Modelica SVN or GitHub repositories, then follow
the tool- and OS- specific instructions below.

If you want to experiment with the code and recompile the static libraries,
check the Projects/CompilationHowTo.txt file.

The library works with FluidProp version 3.0 and later. It might work with
previous versions of that software, but compatibility is no longer guaranteed.


## Dymola under Windows

- Go to the Modelica/ExternalMedia 3.2.1/Resources/Library/win32 directory
- Copy the ExternalMediaLib.Dymola-VS20XX.lib file to a new file named
  ExternalMediaLib.lib in the same directory, according to the version
  of VisualStudio you use with your Dymola installation

You can now load the library, by opening the Modelica/ExternalMedia 3.2.1/package.mo
file

## OpenModelica under Windows

- Go to the Modelica/ExternalMedia 3.2.1/Resources/Library/win32 directory
- Copy the libExternalMediaLib.OMC-gcc.a file to a new file named 
  libExternalMediaLib.a in the same directory

You can now load the library, by opening the Modelica/ExternalMedia 3.2.1/package.mo
file


## For Linux users

You have to compile your own library file to use ExternalMedia on Linux.
It has been tested with Dymola, but should also work with OpenModelica
since they use the same compiler under Linux. 

Please note that you have to add the dl library to the compilation if you 
would like to use NIST REFPROP through the CoolProp interface. For Dymola, 
you can add "-ldl" to the compilation options in the dsbuild.sh file in 
/opt/dymola/insert.

Please follow the developer instructions in `Projects/CompilationHowTo.txt`
to create your own version of ExternalMedia. 


## For developers and other platforms

If you are interested in using ExternalMedia with other Modelica
tools and/or other operating systems and/or other external codes
for fluid property computation, please contact the main
developer francesco.casella@polimi.it
