# For developers and Linux users

This directory contains the C/C++ source files in the Sources directory
and script files to build the library using different Modelica tools,
operating systems, and C/C++ compilers.


## BUILDING THE LIBRARY FOR DYMOLA USING MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO ON WINDOWS

Run the BuildLib-Dymola-VS20XX.bat script corresponding to the version
of Visual Studio that Dymola uses to compile the simulation executable.
This can be done from the Windows console (cmd.exe), or just by
double-clicking on the .bat file from the file explorer.

The scripts build the static library, copies it twice to the Resources/Library
directory of the Modelica library, once with a version- and tool-specific name,
for archival on the SVN server, and once with the appropriate name ExternalMediaLib.lib,
which is loaded by the Modelica tool. Note that this latter file is not stored
as such on the SVN repo, because there are different versions of it depending
the compiler used. Finally, it copies the externalmedia.h header file into the 
Resources/Include directory. In this way, the library can be used right away
by loading the main package.mo file immediately after running the compile script.

For library maintenance, it is suggested that the Visual Studio binary libraries
are updated on the SVN server when major changes or bugfixes are applied to the
source code, so that other users can benefit without the need of recompiling them


## BUIDING THE LIBRARY FOR OPENMODELICA USING GCC ON WINDOWS

- Get the OMDEV environment from the SVN repository:
  https://openmodelica.org/svn/OpenModelicaExternal/trunk/tools/windows/OMDev
  user: anonymous
  pass: none
- Install OMDEV in the C:\OMDev path
- Start C:\OMDev\tools\msys\msys.bat (You should get a command window pop up
  that looks like the emulation of a unix prompt - because it is)
- $ mount d:/Path_to_your_ExternalMediaLibrary_working_copy /ExternalMediaLibrary
- $ cd /ExternalMediaLibrary/Projects
- $ BuildLib-OMC-gcc-windows.sh
 
This will build the static gcc library and copy it and the externalmedia.h
header files in the Resource directories of the Modelica packages, so it can
be used right away by just loading the Modelica package in OMC


## For Dymola users on Linux systems

This procedure has not been tested with OpenModelica. Please report any errors
in order to help us to improve the Linux support of ExternalMedia. 

Please compile the source code using the `makefile-linux` from the console:
- Go to the `Projects`directory: `cd Projects`
- Compile the files: `make -f makefile-linux header library`
- Install the files: `make -f makefile-linux install`

You can now load the library, by opening the package.mo file
